# EDA-and-data-visualization-of-Bird-Strikes-between-2000-2011

Transport and communication, vital sectors in analytics, face pressing concerns regarding environmental impact and safety, particularly in urban areas with growing populations and vehicle numbers. As solutions are sought, emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, notably Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), are being recognized for their potential in addressing these challenges effectively. Bird strikes, defined as collisions between birds and aircraft, pose significant safety risks, often causing damage to aircraft structures and engine failures, with potentially fatal consequences. These strikes are most likely during take-off, initial climb, approach, and landing phases due to the higher presence of birds at lower altitudes.
